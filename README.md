# Spotify Most Streamed Songs – Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores trends and patterns in Spotify’s most streamed songs using Python and data analysis techniques.
The goal was to understand what drives streaming popularity through data cleaning and visualization and feature engineering.
